This is yokobabwe, a WordPress 3.1 theme based on Yoko by Elmastudio.

This theme is in use on timbabwe.com, and since Yoko is GPL, I have chosen to also release this theme under GPL.

The most recent version of the theme can always be found at Github <https://github.com/tkrajcar/yokobabwe>.

I will attempt to keep a document named CHANGES in the theme that documents what I have changed from the base Yoko.

THIS THEME IS NOT SUITED FOR NON-DEVELOPERS. I may well have things hard-coded for my site. Patches will be welcome to un-do any of these, if anybody ends up using it.

Just to be clear:

THERE IS NO WARRANTY ON THIS THEME.
THIS THEME SHOULD NOT BE USED ON PRODUCTION SITES.
THERE IS NO EXPECTATION OF SUPPORT OFFERED FOR THIS THEME.

That said, feel free to email me with questions, and I'll reply as able.
